# DebtsTracker
A simple web app to keep debts tracked. Developed just for practice (and to prevent me and my dad from storing debts on WhatsApp), it runs on the AWS Cloud and involves an Angular FE along with a Node.js BE. As the aim was exploring the topic for the first time, some components have been intentionally built from scratch, even if existing on std libraries.
